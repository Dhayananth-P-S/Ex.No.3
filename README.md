## Introduction  
Prompt Engineering is a crucial technique in modern AI systems, especially when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.  
A well-structured prompt allows the AI to generate precise, relevant, and high-quality responses.  
In this experiment, we explore multiple prompting techniques and apply them to a real-world use case from **Unit 5 – Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**.

---

## Aim  
To write and evaluate prompts for the following prompt types:  
- Straightforward Prompts  
- Tabular Format Prompting  
- Preceding Question Prompting  
- Missing Word Prompting  

Using a **Unit 5 use case**, evaluate the quality of responses and prepare a scenario-based report.

## Theory  

### What is Prompt Engineering?  
Prompt engineering is the process of designing, structuring, and refining prompts to obtain the most relevant and useful responses from AI models.

### Need for Prompt Engineering  
- Enhances accuracy of AI-generated responses  
- Reduces ambiguity and improves output consistency  
- Saves time by producing focused results in fewer iterations  

### Types of Prompting  
1. **Straightforward Prompting**  
   - Simple, direct instructions.  
   - Example: `"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."`  

2. **Tabular Format Prompting**  
   - Requests structured, tabular data for better visualization.  
   - Example: `"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."`  

3. **Preceding Question Prompting**  
   - Asks a main question followed by a related sub-question.  
   - Example: `"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."`  

4. **Missing Word Prompting**  
   - AI fills in the blanks with the most appropriate term.  
   - Example: `"The capital of France is ____."`

## Procedure  

### Use Case: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

---

### 1. Straightforward Prompts
**Prompt:**  
`List three applications of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.`  

**Generated Output:**  
- Disease diagnosis (e.g., cancer detection through image recognition)  
- Personalized treatment planning  
- Predictive analytics for patient risk assessment  

---

### 2. Tabular Format Prompting
**Prompt:**  
`Create a table listing AI applications in healthcare, their description, and one real-world example.`  

**Generated Output:**

| **AI Application**       | **Description**                                | **Example**                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Medical Imaging        | AI analyzes X-rays, CT scans, MRIs to detect anomalies | Google DeepMind detecting eye diseases |
| Virtual Health Assistants | Chatbots providing symptom checking and guidance | Babylon Health chatbot |
| Predictive Analytics   | Predicts patient risks based on historical data | IBM Watson predicting sepsis risk |
| Drug Discovery         | AI accelerates new drug molecule discovery | BenevolentAI |
| Robotic Surgery        | AI-assisted robots perform precise operations | Da Vinci Surgical System |

---

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting
**Prompt:**  
`Why is AI important in healthcare? Explain how AI helps in early disease detection.`  

**Generated Output:**  
AI plays a crucial role in healthcare by improving diagnosis accuracy, minimizing human error, and enabling faster decision-making.  
It assists in early disease detection by analyzing patient records, imaging data, and clinical history to find early symptoms or biomarkers.  
Example: AI models can detect breast cancer at early stages through mammogram image analysis.

### 4. Missing Word Prompting
**Prompt:**  
`AI-powered chatbots in healthcare are used to provide ____ to patients.`  

**Generated Output:**  
**Answer:** `instant medical guidance and symptom assessment.`

---

## Evaluation Method  
We used human evaluation based on the following metrics:  
- **Relevance:** Output aligns with the use case  
- **Clarity:** Responses are clear, precise, and easy to understand  
- **Completeness:** Covers multiple aspects of healthcare applications  
- **Creativity:** Provides practical and real-world examples  

**Result:** All prompt types produced high-quality, relevant outputs.

---

## Advantages of Using Prompt Engineering  
- Ensures focused and relevant responses  
- Saves time and effort by avoiding irrelevant output  
- Helps in creating structured data for reports  
- Improves AI interpretability and reliability  

---

## Applications  
- **Education:** Creating quizzes, tables, and explanations  
- **Healthcare:** Generating medical insights, patient guidance  
- **Business:** Structured report generation, summaries  
- **Research:** Fast information retrieval with context  

---

## Conclusion  
The various prompt types were successfully executed for the chosen use case from Unit 5.  
Each prompt type generated relevant and structured outputs, proving the importance of Prompt Engineering in AI-based scenario report development.

---

## Result  
Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, and the scenario-based report was generated with clear, structured, and meaningful insights.
