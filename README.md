## Aim  
To write prompts for the following prompt types – Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Preceding Question Prompting, and Missing Word Prompting – and evaluate them using a use case from **Unit 5**.

---

## Explanation  
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to obtain optimal responses from AI models.  
In this experiment, we will demonstrate four prompt types:

1. **Straightforward Prompts**  
2. **Tabular Format Prompting**  
3. **Preceding Question Prompting**  
4. **Missing Word Prompting**  

We will use a **Unit 5 Use Case** – *Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare* – to generate responses.

---

## Procedure  

### 1. Straightforward Prompts
**Prompt:**  
`List three applications of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.`  

**Generated Output:**  
- Disease diagnosis (e.g., detecting cancer using image recognition)  
- Personalized medicine and treatment planning  
- Predictive analytics for patient risk assessment  

---

### 2. Tabular Format Prompting
**Prompt:**  
`Create a table listing AI applications in healthcare, their description, and one real-world example.`  

**Generated Output:**

| **AI Application**       | **Description**                                | **Example**                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Medical Imaging        | AI analyzes X-rays, CT scans, MRIs to detect anomalies | Google DeepMind detecting eye diseases |
| Virtual Health Assistants | Chatbots providing symptom checking and guidance | Babylon Health chatbot |
| Predictive Analytics   | Predicts patient risks based on historical data | IBM Watson predicting sepsis risk |
| Drug Discovery         | AI accelerates new drug molecule discovery | BenevolentAI |
| Robotic Surgery        | AI-assisted robots perform precise operations | Da Vinci Surgical System |

---

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting
**Prompt:**  
`Why is AI important in healthcare? Explain how AI helps in early disease detection.`  

**Generated Output:**  
AI is important in healthcare because it improves accuracy, reduces human error, and provides faster results.  
AI helps in early disease detection by analyzing medical images, lab results, and patient history to identify patterns that doctors might miss.  
For example, AI models can detect early signs of breast cancer in mammograms, allowing timely treatment.

---

### 4. Missing Word Prompting
**Prompt:**  
`AI-powered chatbots in healthcare are used to provide ____ to patients.`  

**Generated Output:**  
**Answer:** `instant medical guidance and symptom assessment.`

---

## Evaluation Method  
We evaluated the generated outputs using **human evaluation**, checking for:  
- **Relevance:** All outputs matched the healthcare use case.  
- **Clarity:** Responses were easy to understand and precise.  
- **Completeness:** Covered multiple aspects of AI in healthcare.

---

## Conclusion  
The various types of prompts were successfully executed for the chosen use case from Unit 5. Each prompt type provided relevant and accurate responses, demonstrating the usefulness of prompt engineering techniques in generating scenario-based reports.

---

## Result  
Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, and the report was generated as expected.
